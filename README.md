Email Dr. Miller:

(1) Ask for FASTA files he wants to use as input

(2) Aside from amino acid percentages, are there any other specific statistics he wants us to analyze?

(3) Are there any publications that would be particularly useful for background info?

(4) What previous computational work has been done on this project, if any?
